# Thoughts on OSv

Here the authors provide their personal thoughts on the system.

## Sarah Morin

I thoroughly enjoyed learning about OSv. I enjoy the idea of systems attempting to compromise the pros and cons of virtual machines and containers; however, I'm not sure if it is anything more than an interesting idea. Throughout my research I found much more information specific to clean-slate unikernels than I found for OSv or legacy unikernels in general. It makes me beg the question: are the benefist of OSv and other legacy unikernels over containers and full VMs actually worth the effort? Are clean-slate unikernels the preferred unikernel? I don't have enough experience in production level cloud system to venture a guess the costs and benefits of clean-slate vs. legacy; however, the internet certainly seems more tantilized by the clean-slate option.
