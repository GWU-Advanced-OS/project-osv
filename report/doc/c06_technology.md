## Technology

The core technologies include the single address space, thread scheduler with lock-free algorithms and networking channels, ZFS file system.
It is the hypervisor that multiplexes the hardware into different applications and the application runs in a single address space, which does not need to copy and validate system call parameters. Therefore, the context switches are faster and more efficient. Also, when packets are transferred from hardware to application threads, threads use the lock-free algorithms to avoid the thread switches. When lock is necessary, OSv provides a lock-free mutex without a spin-lock. Whatâ€™s more, ordinary thread handles interrupts in a special interrupt context rather than in OSv. Unlike the traditional spin-locks when protecting data from multiple access at a same time, OSv chooses to wake up the interrupt-handling thread to do the interrupt processing tasks. If locks are needed, it chooses to use a mutex rather than a spin-lock. When threads receive packets from the classifier, OSv reduces much overhead by removing the socket locks, TCP/IP lock and packets are processed at the application level.  Instead of using the VFS file system, in OSv ZFS has many more advantages including easy to create and grow automatically within the space.
